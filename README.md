# Pet.rx [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cellphone4ET/pet-rx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cellphone4ET/pet-rx)

Pet.rx is a user-friendly and fully-responsive web application that allows you to take control of your pet's health care records. With the ability to track vaccination records, weight, chronic conditions, and other relevant metrics across time you’ll never be left wondering the state of your pets health again.

#### Motivation

Managing health records is not an easy task. Whether it be keeping track of your own information or someone else’s, it is way too easy to miss annual checkups due to disorganization and forgetfulness. After an international move with my dog, Yoda, it became even more apparent to me that there had to be a better way to store my pet’s health information in one easily accessible place.

Out of this need, Pet.rx was born.

Regardless of whether or not you have access to your past veterinarians and their often hard-to-decipher records of your pets health you can now easily store, manage, and track all your pets health information with ease from wherever you are with Pet.rx.
